# slot-car-timer
By Howard Pinder     Original work done in Nov. 2016, updated Sept 2020.
 
This implements a race timer for a slot car track, using an Arduino, IR LEDs and IR photodiodes to detect movement, and
 a color TFT display to show the results. I used Arduino Leonardo, but an Arduino UNO would do just fine.

This was designed for my Carrera GO! two-track layout, which is around 52 track pieces, and 30 feet in length.
  But it is adaptable for any scale and track length.

Features:
* Supports a race on one track only (i.e. time trial), or both tracks in a classic head-to-head race.
* Supports racing in either direction, and detects this direction automatically. 
* Supports the two tracks racing in opposite directions.
* Saves the last lap, best lap for current race, and record lap across all races since power-up
* Uses a custom font for the numbers.

I highly recommend adding a track timer to your slot car setup!
This has increased our enjoyment of the track tremendously. 
It is truly worth the effort to get set up, you will be rewarded with a lot of terrific racing fun!
 
Please feel free to use this software to build your own race timer.
If you'd like, send me a photo of your track!  pinderh at gmail dot com

The schematic diagram for the circuit is included, and a photo of the sensor layout.

Also, a photo of my setup is included to give you an idea.
